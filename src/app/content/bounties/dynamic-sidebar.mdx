# Bounty - Dynamic Sidebar

## Take a look at our open-source repo at: <span>[Github](https://github.com/igorfelipeduca/sig-bounties)</span>

As you can see, our sidebar currently is not dynamic. Our routes are set in a variable called `defaultItems` inside the file `src/app/bounties/components/sidebar.tsx`. We want to make it dynamic, so we can add new routes without having to change the code.

## **TODO**
[ ] Read the files, folders and subfolders inside of the `src/app/content/bounties` directory and render all of the found directories as items in the sidebar.

[ ] Turn the readed directories into routes in the sidebar.

## **How does it need to look?**

You need to make sure that the sidebar is dynamic, so if we add a new folder inside of the `src/app/content/bounties` directory, it will automatically be added to the sidebar.
Also, while there is a subfolder inside of the folder, it needs to have a arrow that when clicked, will open the subfolder and show the subfolder's content.

## **How much do we pay?**

This is quite a simple bounty and I don't think it will take that much time to complete. So we will pay **R$50,00** for this bounty.
